# HandBook - Social Media App

![HandBook Screenshot](socialApp)

HandBook is a social media app built using React. It allows users to create posts, interact with others, and engage in meaningful conversations. This app is designed to be a platform where people can share ideas, news, and experiences.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). You can start developing and customizing your app using the following commands.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.  
The page will reload when you make changes.  
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
For more information about running tests, visit [React Testing Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/testing.html).

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It optimizes the build for the best performance and minifies the code for deployment.  
Your app is now ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note:** This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!  
If you want more control over the configuration (e.g., Webpack, Babel, ESLint), you can run this command to eject the setup. This will give you full control over the build process, but it comes at the cost of additional complexity.

> You don't have to eject unless you need advanced configurations. The default setup works well for most use cases.

## Features
